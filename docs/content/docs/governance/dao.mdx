# DAO

Upgradeable DAO contract using UUPS proxy pattern.

**Inherits:** UUPSUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable

## Overview

The DAO contract provides:
- Upgradeable governance logic
- Owner-controlled upgrades
- Initializable state

## Functions

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize() public initializer
```

Initializes the DAO contract. Must be called once after deployment.

### _authorizeUpgrade

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner
```

Authorizes an upgrade to a new implementation. Only callable by owner.

## Deployment

The DAO uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern:

```solidity
import "@luxdao/DAO.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Proxy.sol";

// Deploy implementation
DAO implementation = new DAO();

// Deploy proxy
ERC1967Proxy proxy = new ERC1967Proxy(
    address(implementation),
    abi.encodeCall(DAO.initialize, ())
);

// Use proxy as DAO
DAO dao = DAO(address(proxy));
```

## Upgrading

To upgrade the DAO:

```solidity
// Deploy new implementation
DAOV2 newImplementation = new DAOV2();

// Upgrade (only owner)
dao.upgradeToAndCall(address(newImplementation), "");
```

## Security

- **UUPS Pattern**: Upgrade logic in implementation, not proxy
- **Owner-Only Upgrades**: Only owner can authorize upgrades
- **Initializer Guard**: `initialize()` can only be called once
